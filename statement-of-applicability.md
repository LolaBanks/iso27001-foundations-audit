# Statement of Applicability (Sample)

This is a **sample Statement of Applicability (SoA)** created for educational
purposes. It links **identified risks** to ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A controls
and shows how risks are treated.

⚠️ This is a simulated example and not a real organizational document.

---

## 1. Purpose of the SoA

The Statement of Applicability:

- Shows which Annex A controls are **implemented**
- Explains why certain controls are **included or excluded**
- Demonstrates **risk treatment decisions**
- Serves as a **central reference** for internal audits

---

## 2. Risk-to-Control Mapping (Sample)

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Control Reference (Annex A) | Control Implemented? | Treatment Decision |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| R1 | Unauthorized access to employee laptops | A.9.2.6 – Secure log-on procedures | Yes | Mitigate |
| R2 | Phishing attack on company email | A.7.2.2 – Information security awareness training | Yes | Mitigate |
| R3 | Data breach in customer database | A.9.4.1 – Access control to networks and systems | Yes | Mitigate |
| R4 | Service downtime due to malware | A.12.6.1 – Management of technical vulnerabilities | No | Accept |

**Notes:**

- **Mitigate:** Controls are applied to reduce risk.  
- **Accept:** Risk is acknowledged and deemed manageable.  
- **No:** Control not implemented because risk is low or alternative measures exist.

## 3. How to Read This SoA

1. **Risk ID:** Matches the risk assessment document.  
2. **Control Reference:** ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A clause number.  
3. **Control Implemented?:** Yes / No / Partial  
4. **Treatment Decision:** Mitigate / Accept / Transfer / Avoid  

This is how auditors and management can see **what is being protected and how**.

---

## 4. Key Takeaways

- The SoA is the **link between risks and controls**  
- It demonstrates **risk-based thinking** required by ISO 27001  
- Even as a beginner, a **simulated SoA shows understanding of audit concepts**  
- Proper documentation in GitHub builds credibility
